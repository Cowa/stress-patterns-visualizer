# Stress Patterns Visualizer

> The goal is to "do something" with the data sets

This is my something.

## Purpose

As human, learn something from data is hard if we can't visualize it in a way it makes sense.  
With a stress pattern formatted like this `1,w0w0w0w0w0w0w0,s0s0s0s0s0s2s0`, what can you say in 2 seconds?

Not much.

Because it's made in a way the machine can read and manipulate it easily. But we are humans, right?
We can't make any relevant decisions about this data. We can't find something to be learned by the machine.
We keep trying to read the data. This is a waste of time. We should only care about what the data is. And what is interesting in it.

This is why **Stress Patterns Visualizer** was made. It lets you visualize your stress patterns in a snap.
No more reading. You focus on what the data is. You focus on your work.

For example, let's say you have this patterns:

```
2,w0w0,s2s0
3,w0w0w0,s0s2s0
4,w0w0w0w0,s0s0s2s0
5,w0w0w0w0w0,s0s0s0s2s0
```

You have 2 seconds to find the feature... Too late.

Now visualize it:

</p>

Easier right? The primary stress is on the second to last syllable.
